Something about enzymes and keys And that the cure is just waiting for the disease</p>\r\n<p>We checked in on him last week with the window cracked, you could just hear him speak.</p>\r\n<p>I asked him which bug was worse. Did he miss the rush and that other nurse? &lsquo;He&rsquo;s a vent jockey now, he's probably cursed.&rsquo;</p>\r\n<p>Please tell him feel better soon I hope you feel better soon Please we need you all to stick around We need the good ones to stick around</p>\r\n<p>I know it&rsquo;s strange with me here and you away I&rsquo;m a sad excuse, getting sadder every day. But I&rsquo;ll do my best to hold things down We&rsquo;re all counting the days till you&rsquo;re back in town</p>\r\n<p>Please tell her feel better soon I hope you feel better soon</p>", song_order: 1, album_id: 2)
mee = Song.create(title: "M.E.E.", trt: "11:40", notes: "<p>Written during the quarantine months of the pandemic, &ldquo;M.E.E.&rdquo; (Mass Extinction Events) renders life&rsquo;s rise and fall at the epoch level. My son was working on his seventh-grade science homework and while trying to help him memorize Ordvocian, Devonian, Triassic, Jurassic, Paleogene - a strange melody kept repeating in my head. First, I thought it was &ldquo;Ring Around the Rosie&rdquo; - not quite. Trying to get this melody down in my clumsy, drawn MIDI was my first attempt at composing for a quartet. I added my own harmonium and processing to the piece and then sent the sheet music to some &ldquo;real&rdquo; musicians for the recording. Essentially, &ldquo;M.E.E.&rdquo; is two epochs, with the traces of the first part being side-chained through the second. Each era terminates with exploring the science-homework melody.</p>\r\n<dl>\r\n<dt>Maria Grigoryeva</dt>\r\n<dd>violin, viola, additional engineering</dd>\r\n<dt>Lyudmila Kadyrbaeva</dt>\r\n<dd>cello</dd>\r\n<dt>Zoltan Renaldi</dt>\r\n<dd>double bass</dd>\r\n<dt>Gabriel Walsh</dt>\r\n<dd>harmonium, tapes</dd>\r\n</dl>", lyrics: "", song_order: 1,album_id: empty.id)
rocks = Song.create(title: "Where There are Rocks…", trt: "6:16", notes: "<p>While working M.E.E. I had a dream in which two tectonic plates were grinding against one another. The rock turned molten along the fault line, and from it arose a sort of consciousness, violent and cunning. I began &ldquo;constructing&rdquo; the piece with two deep bass lines. The parts were identical, except that one was flipped backward. This often created wobbling, dissonant intervals. I then used a contact microphone on stones to build the underworldly ambiance. The piece&rsquo;s name comes from Alan Watts:</p>\r\n<blockquote>&ldquo;Where there are rocks, watch out! Watch out because the rocks are going to eventually come alive, and they are going to have people crawling over them. It is only a matter of time, just in the same way the acorn is eventually going to turn into the oak because it has the potentiality of that within it.&rdquo;</blockquote>", lyrics: "", song_order: 2,album_id: empty.id)
